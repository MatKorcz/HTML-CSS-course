*           ###FLOAT PROPERTY:###              *
*----------------------------------------------*

For build menu buttons usually we do not use display: inline-block, but float property. Float is moving block objects to the side that we direct. E.G.:

float: left; means that block will moved to the left side. Float property solve problem with strange margins from line obj.
Problem with float is that parent doesn't see child's height. So if it is needed, you have to type into parent's rule child's height.

*IMPORTANT*
VH include scrolling rectangle. if you use wight with % value it dosn't count scrolling rectangle.
