***In CSS we use the so-called Rules:*** 
      _________________________
e.g. | h1 { property: value; } |
      -------------------------
Rules allows us changing properties of the object.
To select choosed object we use "Selectors", for choosing specific obj. we use "Combinators".



***SELECTORS:***

If you selecting "normal" selector like h1, p, span etc. You have to type simply
name of this selector like for e.g. h1 {}

If you are going to choose class selector, before name you have to type "." e.g.: .ClassName {}



***COMBINATORS:***

Avaible combinators (with e.g. selectors) are shown below:

p  h1 {} - means h1 descendant of p (in contrast to p>h1, h1 don't have to be directly 
           descendant of p. The h1 can be e.g. inside of span which is inside of this p and this "h1" is
           selected too)

p + p {} - means that we choosing the second "p" (this one after +) which is his "younger brother"
           so if you type p + p + p {} - that means that you select last 2x p.

p ~ p {} - means that we are choosing second p, and every next p (like p+p+p+p...).

p>h1     - means that we are selecting a DIRECT descendant of p (so h1)
           so if you type p>h1>span {} - that means you select span of h1 of p.

*{}      - means every selector.

p,h1  {} - means that we are selecting 2 selectors at same time.



***Assembling CSS:***
You can quickly put it on <head> in HTML file using there index <style> </style> just for quickly
testing our solution. But finally we have use external file .css and link it in HTML by <link>
